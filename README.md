# Analysis-Capstone
When completing my Google data analytics certification, I was given a prompt for a capstone project. For this project, I analyzed Fitbit data for a women's health company to help them create a new marketing strategy for their smart devices. The data was cleaned using Excel and then analyzed with R studio. 


The data I used can be found on Kaggle at this URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit.
