# Analysis-Capstone
For this project, I analyzed Fitbit data for a women's health company to help them create a new marketing strategy for their smart devices. The data was cleaned using Excel and then analyzed with R studio. 

During analysis, there were many null values that had to be filtered out that was likely due to people not wearing their smart devices consistently every day. 

I found that the weight log data couldn't be analyzed as it only included 8 participants with only 5 participants tracking their weight on a regular basis. The other three participants only entered theirs in once or twice, and it wasn't logged over time, so no conclusions could be drawn based on this data. In addition, the sleep log was only completed by 26 participants. Either this data must be logged manually or the other 7 users not included in this dataset removed their device at night. 

The most beneficial marketing strategy for Bellabeat would be to hire an influencer that could show off all of the tools of their smart device, such as tracking heart rate, daily steps, and calories burned. Also, they should include reminder notifications for people who want to keep track of their sleep or weight
